Gave [goproxy](https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy) a spin and guess what? it rules!

Pardon my poor Go skills (feel free to suggest improvements)

On the `goproxy-use-cases.go` file you'll find different tasks that can be toggled and tweaked as necessary.


Uses cases to attempt next:

* better housecleaning (deferred closing of resources)
* rewrite URL
* serve streamed files (ex: video)
* add CORS headers
